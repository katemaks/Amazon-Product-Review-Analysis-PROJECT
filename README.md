# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis-PROJECT
This is a complete Analysis documentation on the project Amazon-Product-Review with Digital Skillup Africa.
Athough I started the third project on my own but got stocked on the way. However, with the assistance of a friend from my squad, I managed to do this Amazon project. I am yet to boost confidence on Excel but I will go over it again till I can beat my chest.

## Project Topic: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce platforms like Amazon.
By analysing the various parameters in the data given, I seek to gather enough insight from customer's review and analysing the product so as to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.
